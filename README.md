## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Ruby (latest version)
- Rails (latest version)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL database

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Essyuge/Tasks-API

1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd tasks-api

2. Install gem dependencies:
bundle install

3. Configure the database connection in config/database.yml.

4. Create and migrate the database:
rails db:create
rails db:migrate

5. Start the Rails server:
rails server 
```


## Usage

This API is designed to be easy to integrate into your projects. You can use it as a standalone API or integrate it into web and mobile applications. Below are some basic examples of how to interact with the API:

### Get a list of tasks

Retrieve a list of tasks with a GET request to /tasks.
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/tasks
```
### Create a New Task

Send a POST request to `/tasks` with the task details in the request body.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "title": "Complete project proposal",
  "description": "Create a detailed project proposal for the upcoming sprint.",
  "due_date": "2023-11-15"
}' http://localhost:3000/tasks
```
### Update a task

Send a PUT request to /tasks/:id with the updated task details.
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "title": "Complete project proposal (Updated)",
  "description": "Create a detailed project proposal for the upcoming sprint (Updated).",
  "due_date": "2023-11-20"
}' http://localhost:3000/tasks/1
```

### Delete a task

Send a DELETE request to /tasks/:id to delete a task.
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/tasks/1
```

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following RESTful endpoints:


1. **List All Tasks**
   - Endpoint: `GET /tasks`

2. **Create a Task**
   - Endpoint: `POST /tasks`

3. **Update a Task**
   - Endpoint: `PUT /tasks/:id`

4. **Delete a Task**
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /tasks/:id`

These are the primary endpoints for managing tasks in your API. Replace `:id` with the actual task ID in the `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints when targeting specific tasks. For more detailed information about each endpoint, including request and response examples, please refer to the corresponding sections in this README. 



## Authentication and Authorization

This section outlines the authentication and authorization mechanisms used in the Tasks API. We prioritize security and access control to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can perform specific actions.

### Authentication

The API utilizes [authentication method or gem/library] to authenticate users. Here's how it works:

1. [Explain the authentication process and setup]
2. [Provide details on obtaining authentication tokens or API keys]

### Authorization

To protect your resources, the API employs an authorization mechanism based on user roles or permissions. Users with different roles can access different parts of the API.

1. [Explain how authorization is implemented]
2. [Provide examples of user roles and permissions]

## Error Responses

We provide structured and informative error responses to help developers understand and handle issues effectively. This section lists common error codes and their meanings:

- `401 Unauthorized`: The request requires user authentication, or the provided credentials are invalid.
- `403 Forbidden`: The authenticated user lacks permission to perform the requested action.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource does not exist.
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: The request is well-formed, but the server couldn't process it due to validation errors.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected server error occurred.

For a comprehensive list of error codes and their meanings, refer to the [Error Handling](./ERROR_HANDLING.md) documentation.
<!-- 
## Database

The API relies on a  SQlite database to store task data. The database schema includes tables for tasks and users to ensure data integrity and security. This section provides details about the database structure.
